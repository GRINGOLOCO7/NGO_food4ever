                    After some discussion with the group, I was appointed as the Executive director; this decision was made because, whenever in a group, I have often taken a directive role and, therefore, perfectly understand its qualifications. I will be expected to lead the team in the correct pathway, ensuring that the ideas, projects, and concepts all fit in the general window of an NPO. I will also ensure that my team constantly remains motivated and, through adequate team management, that they will work in perfect synergy.
